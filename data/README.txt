# JusticeAI - AI-Driven Legal Assistant for Sexual Offense Investigations

This directory is for PDF legal reference documents that power the JusticeAI system.

## Important Note: Fully AI-Driven Architecture

JusticeAI is designed as a true AI-powered system with NO hardcoded elements. All legal analysis, questions, recommendations, and guidance are generated dynamically by the AI model based on:

1. The specific case details entered by the investigating officer
2. The content of the PDF legal documents in this folder
3. The answers to AI-generated follow-up questions

## Required PDF Documents

Place the following PDF files in this directory to enable the AI to provide accurate legal guidance:

1. `250883_english_01042024-BNS.pdf` - The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita document
2. `SOP for Investigation and Prosecution of Rape against Women -Final submitted (Revised) to JS WS MHA.pdf` - Standard Operating Procedures
3. `303-delhi police.pdf` - Delhi Police guidelines for sexual offense investigations
4. `Hackathon datasets 2025 PDF file.pdf` - Case precedents and judicial guidance

## How the AI Uses These Documents

The AI will:
- Extract relevant sections based on case details (e.g., victim age, offense type)
- Generate tailored questions based on legal requirements found in these documents
- Identify applicable sections and procedures from the PDF content
- Cross-reference case facts with legal standards in these documents
- Provide dynamic guidance that evolves as more case information is provided

## Dynamic Content Generation

Nothing in this system is pre-programmed or hardcoded. The AI:
- Generates different questions for each unique case
- Recommends different legal sections based on specific case details
- Identifies different compliance requirements based on jurisdiction and case type
- Provides custom document templates tailored to the specific case

This ensures that the system remains flexible, up-to-date with legal changes, and provides truly case-specific guidance.
