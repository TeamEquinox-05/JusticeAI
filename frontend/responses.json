However, the harm she described was psychological and professional in nature: she experienced stress, humiliation, and emotional discomfort from being subjected to repeated unwanted sexual conversations, and she testified that she felt intimidated and powerless due to Clarence Thomas’s position of authority over her. Such harassment, even without physical contact, can cause lasting emotional distress, anxiety, and damage to professional opportunities, which are legally recognized as forms of injury in workplace harassment cases.",
        "3": "In Anita Hill’s case against Clarence Thomas, the specific clothing worn by the accused at the time of the alleged harassment was never detailed in testimony or official records. The allegations centered on verbal sexual harassment in workplace settings, not on physical incidents where attire might have been relevant. Most reports and transcripts of the hearings focus on the content of the conversations, the power dynamic, and the impact on Hill, rather than describing what Thomas was wearing.",
        "4": "During the 1991 Senate hearings, Anita Hill was the primary witness, testifying under oath that Clarence Thomas had subjected her to repeated unwanted sexual conversations; her account was supported by witnesses such as her friend Susan Hoerchner, who confirmed Hill told her of the harassment years earlier, and Angela Wright, another former EEOC employee, who reported similar inappropriate behavior by Thomas (though she was not permitted to testify publicly), while Rose Jourdain described Wright’s emotional distress, all of which provided corroboration even as Thomas himself firmly denied the allegations.",
